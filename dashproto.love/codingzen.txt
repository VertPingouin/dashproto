Code when you are willing to code.
More time != more code.

If you're stuck, quit for one day.
If after one day, you're still stuck, refactor.

Don't get too fond of your code.
Don't be afraid to trash.

If it's not broken, don't fix it.
If it's not slow, don't optimize it.

Code is both intelligence and creativity.
Be inspired.

Have a clear goal in a coding session. Write it down.
Stick to it, when it's achieved, stop.
